I see a few things that needs to be addressed, and something's that can be added to this:

1. Let's add this to the contract dashboard :
CQT on BASE: 0x9d1075b41cd80ab08179f36bc17a7ff8708748ba

Live: https://basescan.org/token/0x9d1075b41cd80ab08179f36bc17a7ff8708748ba#code

---

2. Instead of seperating the Defi Gaming Hub and v4 Defi we should combine them as one dashboard.

3. To ensure admin panel has the proper login let's make sure we have all the right info for MetaMask SDK:
https://docs.metamask.io/sdk/connect/javascript-wagmi/

4. let's remove Super Pay and add it into the admin dashboard well replace Super Pay on the outside with an OnRamper instead and customize for this system:
https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/demo-apps/starter/onramp-demo-app

5. Let's Add Streamlit to the entire design:

I'll search for information about Streamlit's most advanced features and capabilities.

Searched for “Streamlit advanced features functions libraries 2024”

Let me search for more specific information about Streamlit's latest advanced features and components.
